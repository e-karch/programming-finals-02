# Programming Finals 02

This project introduces a file system that dynamically generates a tree-like file structure based on a given file containing multiple files with tags and metadata, such as file type. 
The system organizes files so that frequently accessed ones are placed higher in the hierarchy for improved accessibility.

This program was developed as the second half of the final project for the 'Programmieren' course in the Computer Science bachelor's program at KIT.
